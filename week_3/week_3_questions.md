* Why do the local config dicts use "prefix/stock_9.csv" instead of "data/stock_9.csv"?
* Should the bucket, prefix, and endpoint_url params within the machine_learning_sensor_docker definition be passed in as config, or hardcoded? I'm struggling to see how they can be passed in via config... context.op_config seems wrong...
* What should the body of the machine_learning_schedule_docker definition look like? I ran a test without defining anything and it worked after defining the schedule decorator... 
* Why should we use build_schedule_from_partitioned_job instead of our sensor function definition?
* Why are we defining the static docker config dictionary if we are only using the docker_config() function?
